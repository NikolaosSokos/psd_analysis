# PSD Analysis Report

## Summary of Discussions

### Key Information Derived from PSD Analysis:
1. **Power Distribution**: The PSD captures the power across various frequencies, indicating the noise level at each frequency.
2. **Station Behavior**: It reflects the station's performance in terms of detecting signals versus environmental noise.
3. **Data Quality**: Analysis of PSD helps in identifying anomalies and deviations from expected behavior.
4. **Environmental Insights**: Environmental noise factors like wind or urban activities can be inferred.
5. **Comparison with Standards**: PSDs are compared against New High Noise Model (NHNM) and New Low Noise Model (NLNM) to assess the station's performance.

### Objectives:
- Identify whether PSDs are within NHNM and NLNM boundaries.
- Cluster stations based on PSD patterns.
- Assign meaningful labels to PSD clusters after visual inspection and expert analysis.

### Technical Considerations:
- Use multi-label classification to tag each PSD with multiple labels, representing patterns or anomalies observed.
- Preprocessing steps will include cleaning the PSD images and converting them into feature vectors or embeddings for clustering.
- Clustering will initially group PSDs into broad categories, which can later be labeled.
